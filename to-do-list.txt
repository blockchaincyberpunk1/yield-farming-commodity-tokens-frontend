ethersService.js (Utility Functions)
Start with setting up the ethersService.js under the utils directory. This will include all the functions necessary for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, like connecting to MetaMask, loading contracts, and handling transactions.
React Components
StakeForm.jsx and UnstakeForm.jsx: These forms will handle the user inputs for staking and unstaking operations. They'll use ethersService.js to interact with the blockchain.
CommodityTokenInterface.jsx and YieldFarmingInterface.jsx: Build these components to display information about the tokens and staking details respectively. They should allow users to interact with your smart contracts through buttons and forms.
RewardDistribution.jsx: This component will include functionality for the contract owner to distribute rewards.
App.js (Main Component)
In App.js, import and use all the components created. This file will orchestrate how the components are displayed and interact with each other, managing any shared state if necessary.
Styling (App.css)
Finally, apply styles to your components using App.css. This will improve the user interface's visual appeal and usability.
Testing Each Component
As you complete each component, ensure to test its functionality, either using React's development environment or by deploying to a test blockchain like Ganache.
Integration Testing
Once all components are developed and individually tested, perform integration testing to ensure they work well together and the interactions with the blockchain are functioning as expected.
